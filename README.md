## Content
* [Jumpless case](https://github.com/Poisson12345/Palatini-Higgs-Inflation/blob/main/ScanOverTop_Jumpless.nb) - This notebook analyzes inflation in the case without a jump in coupling constants. For different values of the low-energy top Yukawa coupling, the equations of motion of the inflaton are solved and the amplitude of generated perturbations is computed. In each case, the non-minimal coupling is adjusted in order to maximize the enhancement of the power spectrum or minimize the CMB normalization. This leads to Figure 6 in [2306.03893](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03893).
* [Scenarios with jump](https://github.com/Poisson12345/Palatini-Higgs-Inflation/blob/main/ScanOverXiJump.nb) - This notebook analyzes inflation in the presence of a jump in the Higgs selfcoupling. For a given value of the low-energy top Yukawa coupling, again the equations of motion of the inflaton and the amplitude of generated perturbations are calculated. For different values of the non-minimal coupling, the value of the effective jump is adjusted in order to maximize the enhancement of the power spectrum or minimize the CMB normalization. The cases of positive and negative high-energy Higgs selfcoupling are treated separately, which leads to Figures 8 and 9 in [2306.03893](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03893). Rerunning this notebook for different values of the low-energy top Yukawa coupling, one can obtain Figure 11.
